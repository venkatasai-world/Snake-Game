# 🐍 Snake Game using Python Turtle (OOP)

This project is a simple version of the classic **Snake Game** built using **Python's turtle graphics module**. It follows an **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** approach where everything is organized into classes for better structure and reusability.

## 📚 What I Learned

- ✅ How to create and use **classes and objects** in Python.
- ✅ How to handle **movement** and **collision detection**.
- ✅ How to manage **score tracking** and screen updates.
- ✅ How to use the **turtle module** for graphics.
- ✅ How to structure a game loop and listen to **keyboard events**.

## 🎮 Game Features

- Snake moves with arrow keys (⬆️ ⬇️ ⬅️ ➡️)
- Random **food generation** at new positions
- Snake **grows** after eating food
- **Scoreboard** that updates with every food eaten
- Detects **wall collision** and **self collision**
- Ends the game with a **"GAME OVER"** message

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Turtle module**
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** principles

## ▶️ How to Play

1. Run the Python script.
2. Use arrow keys to control the snake.
3. Eat the red food to grow and score points.
4. Avoid hitting the wall or yourself.

## 📌 File Structure (if split)

- `main.py` – Main game loop and setup
- `snake.py` – Snake class
- `food.py` – Food class
- `scoreboard.py` – Scoreboard class
